His fragrant oils glistened like a butter to his skin, 
and his lumberous body, which he had achieved through the rigor 
of years of World of Warcraft, came down upon me. 
I had never truly noticed such a specimen. Each layer to his body, different. 
As if the delicacies of the world could be sought through his pepperoni back, 
like an italian pizza and smelt like the garlic 
of a kitchen which had been roasting for a good twelve hours. 
His lips appeared moist and succulent, 
As if they had been wetted, every hour, on the hour, by his carmex lip balm. 
And his fingers as they glided across my arms, smoothing over down from my shoulders until he took my hands. 
Thick, like summer sausage. Soft, with the sweet traction of the mountain dew dibble, which he had been sipping earlier.
