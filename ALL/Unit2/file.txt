//His lumberous body bear over,
//And the sweet scent of cheeto musk waft over me.

His fragrant oils glistened
like a butter to his skin,
and his lumberous body, 
which he had achieved through the rigor
of years of World of Warcraft, came down upon me.
I had never truly noticed such a specimen.
Each layer to his body, different.
As if the delicacies of the world could be sought through his pepperoni back,
like an italian pizza and smelt like the garlic
(like a kitchen which had been roasting garlic for twelve hours).
of a kitchen which had been roasting for a good twelve hours.

His lips appeared moist and succulent,
As if they had been wetted, every hour, on the hour, by his carmex lip balm.
And his fingers as they glided across my arms, smoothing over down from my shoulders until he took my hands. 
Thick, like summer sausage. Soft, with the sweet traction of the mountain dew he had been sipping earlier.
